# Iran Stock Prediction
This is a tool for traders to help them decide to buy/sell/hold, or for ML engineers who want to make their hands dirty in working with Time series/Economical data. 

# How to Use
Need more implementations.

# Dataset we used
The following three primary reasons led us to choose [pytse-client](https://github.com/Glyphack/pytse-client) library as our ML dataset of the Iranian stock market:
1. Data is updated daily and non-stop.
2. Contains valuable data about individual sales and purchases.
3. Has a history of buying stocks over long periods.
